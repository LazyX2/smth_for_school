23 of September, 2023: I started to make this web app because Emily asked me to make an app for the school's staff to communicate
in cases of issues with technology in the school due to the fact that Michelle is usually getting the same message over and over
from different teachers (according to Emily) so I started making this web app to create that and at this point, I only used
javascript, node.js, and express.js. I started using static files and the such but still, it's still in the early development
stage of the product so I don't know if I would be able the finish this quickly before the start of the day of forgiveness.
